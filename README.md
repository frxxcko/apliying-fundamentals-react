Some of the topics you might see in this project as for today:

- Two Way Binding
- Dinamyc Rendering implementing <strong>map()</strong> method
- UX and Conditional rendering
- Popup Modal and it's logic
- Validations
- Little bit of Styling, later I'll implement <strong>Material UI</strong> and/or <strong>Styled Components</strong> 

# Goals to be acomplished in the next iteration

# Notes
This project is still under development, I'm triying to build a simple React App that implements all the fundamentals of React and more.
